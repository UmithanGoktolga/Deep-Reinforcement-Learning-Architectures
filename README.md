Repo containing to-dos and instructions for DRL in POMDPs.jl  

# Getting Started

If you are new to reinforcement learning, and decision making under uncertatiny in general, let's first get you up to speed on the fundamentals. 

## Reinforcement Learning

Watch parts 1, 2, 9, and 10 from the Udacity course below:

https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271

The course covers many topics, but the ones we care about, are the funcdamentals of AI, probability, MDPs, and Reinforcement Learning.

## Deep Learning

Let's get started by watching some videos that explain deep learning at a high level (for best results watch them in order):

[TedX talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/fei_fei_li_how_we_re_teaching_computers_to_understand_pictures?language=en) by Fei-Fei Li on describing images with neural networks. 

[Video Exaplnations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9OeZkIwhzfv-_Cb7fCikLQ/videos) of Deep Learning. Watch episodes 2-20.

[Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2dVjADTEDU&feature=youtu.be) by Geoff Hinton on how neural networks really work. 

[Tutorial](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) on neural networks by Andrej Karpathy.
